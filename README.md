Transportation Problem with 3 "What if" Problems

On 16 Nov: 
Team,

Please read through the attached code.  We have adapted a model from HW 2 towards the baseline case for this project.  We haven't ran the code yet. There are a few questions remaining.

If you need help understanding the set notation, just skim though the set notation sections in lingo's user guide (Section 2) . Set notation will save us for this project. Lingo User Guide

One question remaining, is how do we account for a different demand each month?  How do we force the production decision variables, which are arcs from prodfac to store, to recalculate each month?  Is it a loop statement? Any ideas? 

Anyway, my hope is that everybody can read and understand the current progress over the weekend, and we can re-attack as a group on Tues or Wednesday.  Please come with ideas!
